MCTools SafeWallet Download Section

This app is mainly dedicated to store your seedphrases and organize your wallets and accounts in a smart way with tagging them for purposes.

Currently, this version is only for Windows usage.

Instructions:
- Unzip the ZIP-file in a new folder
- run MCTOOLS_SAFEWALLET.exe
- Setup a Master Password (this one is ultra-important and not-recoverable so handle with care)
- Setup your tag categories in settings
- Generate new wallets or import existing ones

Currently, this app is in Alpha state and is looking super-ugly yet until enough feedback is given in Discord () and the needed functions are all completed.

Backup of your data:
- copy file "mctools_walletdata" to a secured location.

This file is highly secured and cannot be decrypted without your Master Password.
